        <p>
            In her first book, Kristin Cavallari shared her personal journey along with her tips on

            being healthy.

        <h2>Selling Boldly: Applying the New Science of Positive Psychology to Dramatically Increase Your
            Confidence, Happiness, and Sales</h2>
        <p>
            Fear is the reason most salespeople don’t like to pick up the phone. Fear is the
            reason we don’t ask for the business more, even though our customers want to buy from us.

        <h2>I’ve Got My Eyes on You (B&N Exclusive Edition)</h2>
        <p>
            A new thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author and “Queen of Suspense” Mary Higgins Clark.
            After a party when her parents are away, eighteen-year-old Kerry Dowling is found fully dressed
            at the bottom of the family pool. The immediate suspect is her boyfriend who had a bitter
            argument with her at the party. Then there is a twenty-year-old neighbor who was angry because
            she didn’t invite him to the party.
